# Rust Crash Course (Loops, Custom Types, and Errors)



------

## Pre-Requisites

**Assumed knowledge (This is a Rust crash course, not a basic coding tutorial)**

- How **variables, loops, conditionals, etc**. work (Basic coding fundamentals will help a lot!)
- Linux (**Terminal/Console proficiency**) (We're going to need to compile our stuff)
- Gone through the all preceding parts of the tutorial

### Good to know

- Other systems programming language knowledge (e.g. C++)
  - It'll help with appreciating the benefits of Rust!

- If you have knowledge of computation structures like variables, functions, OOP, etc. it'll be easier



## Introduction

Now that we know what types are, and what tools Rust affords us, we can start getting funky with the next few steps:

- Loops (`for`, `while`, etc.)
- Custom Types (`structs`, `enums`, type aliases)
- Error handling



## Rust Syntax Reference

### Loops (`loop`, `while`, `for`)






```
                            .     .
                         .  |\-^-/|  .    
                        /| } O.=.O { |\
```
