# Rust Crash Course



------

## Pre-Requisites

**Assumed knowledge (This is a Rust crash course, not a basic coding tutorial)**

- How **variables, loops, conditionals, etc**. work (Basic coding fundamentals will help a lot!)
- Linux (**Terminal/Console proficiency**) (We're going to need to compile our stuff)
- Gone through the all preceding parts of the tutorial

### Good to know

- Other systems programming language knowledge (e.g. C++)
  - It'll help with appreciating the benefits of Rust!

- If you have knowledge of computation structures like variables, functions, OOP, etc. it'll be easier



## Introduction

This section of the tutorial walks you through the basics of Rust, including:

- An overview of what Rust is, why to use it, and how to set up your environment for developing with it
- The toolings Rust affords
- Common programming constructs in Rust



### Preamble: Here be Dragons

Rust has been described to be cognitively frontloaded, in that it has a very steep learning curve, but once you get it, it saves you a boatload of time. This should **not** be a deterrent to learning the language! And the reason why is...

Though it takes a little bit of time to get a Rust program to compile without compiler errors because the compiler is built specifically with safety in mind (enforced at compile time) to stop you from making mistakes, once you get a Rust program to successfully compile (and the compiler provides a lot of helpful warnings and notes to get you there), **it usually does what you want it to**.

>  In fact, it's virtually impossible to [encounter data races](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html) or other [memory issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36136201/how-does-rust-guarantee-memory-safety-and-prevent-segfaults) (e.g. segfaults, double-frees, null or dangling pointers))!

This is a little bit of a different paradigm from C++, where in C++ getting stuff to compile is (relatively) easy, but getting your program to be memory safe and to do what you want it to do will take a lot more time, and **without** a lot of guidance from the compiler!

I think the benefits **far exceed** the learning curve required to train yourself to stop fighting the Rust borrow-checker (explained later) and compiler. Though it will help tremendously to always keep in mind that it'll take a little bit of time to get used to the way Rust works, and to work with the compiler. Keep at it, and you'll be on your way to much safer, error free code in no time! And most importantly, I'll be here every step of the way ;)

Ready? Let's go!!



### What is Rust

> **Rust** is a [multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language), [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language) designed for [performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance) and safety, especially safe [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)). Rust is [syntactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) similar to [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), but can guarantee [memory safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety) by using a *borrow checker* to validate [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)).
>
> Rust achieves memory safety without [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), and [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) is optional. Rust has been called a [systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming) language, and in addition to high-level features such as [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) it also offers mechanisms for [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management).
>
> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

What this means is, that with Rust, you get the same power and speed you can get with C/C++, but with memory safety as a default (we'll go into how later on!) With the tradeoff of a more strict compiler, you get the benefits of safety by default, and a much higher chance your programs will work as expected once they compile successfully!

Beyond that, being a modern, Rust provides some **significant advantages** over C++, built into the language, such as:

- A package and dependency manager that is **version aware** (like Python's `pip`)
  - No more manually managing dependencies and linking libraries!
- Modern tooling
  - Inbuilt testing (and resolution to unit and integration tests)
  - Inbuilt documentation generation (which also runs tests defined in the docstrings!!)

While Rust is still new, the ecosystem has stabilized a lot in the past few years, with large companies both adopting it and contributing to its libraries. It might not be as ubiquitous as C/C++, but it's very much a worthwhile language to learn!

### Setup

#### **Rust Install**

[Rust Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Ready to go? Let's set up your environment for Rust! (I'm on Ubuntu 20.04.)

We can install Rust using `rustup`, which manages updates. This script will settle everything for you, including setting up your PATH environments.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can then go ahead and see what version of Rust you're running with

```shell
rustc --version
```



#### **Dev Tools**

Like with C++, development in Rust is made a lot easier with editors/IDEs. There's a [handy site](https://areweideyet.com/) that tracks support and integrations with some of the more commonly used ones out there.

For myself, I will be using [Atom](https://areweideyet.com/#atom), and this is the setup process for that.

1. Ensure that you've installed the following packages in Atom
   - `ide-rust`, `atom-build`, `build-cargo`
2. Ensure that you've installed the standalone dependency `rust-analyzer` for language support
   - I did this on Ubuntu 20.04 using the [snap store](https://snapcraft.io/install/rust-analyzer/ubuntu)
     - Hence, I needed to add `/snap/bin` to `PATH`!
   - But you might need a [manual install](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation) on other platforms

## Rust Tooling (Basic)

This is just a very cursory look at the toolings available to you in Rust so you can get started. It can go a whole lot deeper, but now is not the time to go through that (perhaps in a different tutorial or section.)

Just be a teeny bit patient, we'll get to the syntax reference soon! It'll be very good to familiarize yourself with the toolings Rust affords you, and how to do several common things!



### Running a Program

#### **Using `rustc`**

The most basic way to run a Rust program is:

```shell
$ rustc <filename>.rs
$ ./<filename>
```



#### **Using `cargo` (Better)**

You can also use the inbuilt package manager, `cargo` to generate a project and run it!

```shell
# Create a new Rust project (with a hello world source!)
$ cargo new hello-rust

# Compile it (run will build it if not built, and then run it)
$ cd hello-rust
$ cargo run
```

You can also build and test it with:

- `cargo build`
- `cargo test`

(I much prefer using my IDE to invoke `cargo` though.)



### Managing Dependencies (Basics)

#### **Crates**

Rust comes with its own package manager (and build system, ... and test runners), `cargo`! It makes it ridiculously easy to download, build, link, and publish packages (called **crates**).

> **Crates**
>
> Crates are units of compiled code, which can either be executables or libraries!



#### **Specifying and Using Dependencies**

You specify the dependencies of a Rust project in its `Cargo.toml` file.

Sample `Cargo.toml` (`#` denotes comments!):

```toml
[package]
name = "some_package"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Local Dep
some_local_package = { path = "../some_local_package" }

# GitHub Dep
zenoh = { git = "https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh.git" }

# From crates.io
env_logger = "0.9.0"
async-std = { version = ">=1.9.0, <2.0.0", default-features = false, features = [
    "attributes",
    "unstable",
] }
```

We see four different ways to be specifying a dependency! Respectively:

- Local
- GitHub
- A crate of a specific version from the ecosystem (crate.io)
- A crate of a range of versions from the ecosystem (crate.io), with additional parameters specifying which features (think sub-modules/components) of the package you're using

There's a lot more to dependency management, but this should be enough to start you off using crates from the ecosystem!



#### **Cargo Lock Files**

> **`Cargo.toml` vs `Cargo.lock`**
>
> - `Cargo.toml` is about describing your dependencies in a broad sense, and is written by you.
> - `Cargo.lock` contains exact information about your dependencies. It is maintained by Cargo and **should not be manually edited**.
>
> [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html)

The lock files allow you to have reproducible builds! They disambiguate any ambiguous versions in the `Cargo.toml` file to specific versions used for the build you just had. This lets you share the `Cargo.lock` file to let others reproduce your build (using the `--locked` flag to use it!)

Furthermore, if `cargo` sees a `Cargo.lock` file in your directory, it'll use that instead of trying to figure out all the specific versions from the `Cargo.toml` file, unless you specifically instruct it to upgrade.

```shell
# Instruct Cargo to Upgrade
$ cargo upgrade
```

### Naming and Casing

Let's use the [Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html)!

Briefly:

- `snake_case` for variables, functions, and modules
- `UpperCamelCase` for types, traits, and enum variants (think classes and OOP)
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

For crate and crate folder names, it's a bit more ambiguous, there's no standard, and crates.io has a mix of these:

- Both `kebab-case` and `snake_case` works, but I'd prefer `snake_case`, in case it matters (:
- You might even be able to mix them if you have a specific reason to do so (e.g. `project-crate_name`)



### More Toolings Resources

If you're interested in looking at more Rust toolings, you can take a look at these resources:

- [Rust Gentle Intro](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro) has:
  - A [section](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/4-modules.html) on dynamically linking crates and stripping them down
  - More cargo magic
- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html)
- [The Rust Embedded Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book) has:
  - A [section](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/interoperability/rust-with-c.html) on using Rust with C/C++ (to call from C/C++)



## Rust Basic Syntax Reference

### Hello World

```shell
$ cargo init hello-world
$ cd hello-world
$ cargo run
```

The `cargo init` command generates the hello world code in `hello-world/src/main.rs`

**Every Rust program consists of a <u>main function</u>**

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, World!");
}
```



### Comments

Comments are meant to increase readability for programmers, and will be ignored by computers!

```rust
// This is a comment

/*
multiline
comment!
*/

/*
 * alternate multiline
 * comment! (Purely stylistic choice)
 */
```

> **Doc Comments**
>
> There are special [doc comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/comments.html#doc-comments) that mean special things for the documentation generator (for generating HTML documentation!) We won't go through in-depth what they do here, but it's best to know them so you can avoid using them and unwittingly do something you don't intend.
>
> Generally:
>
> - `///`
> - `//!`
> - `/**`
> - `/*!`
>
> ```rust
> /// Doc for function following this block
> /// # With Markdown Formattings
> ///
> /// ```
> /// // And code-blocks
> /// // Will ACTUALLY run this when testing
> /// assert!(true, "");
> /// ```
> 
> /** The block version
> */
> ```
>
> ```rust
> //! Standalone doc for this item
> //!
> //! Cool.
> 
> /*! The multiline version
> */
> ```



### Importing Libraries

After you've declared a crate as a dependency, you can import it!

```rust
// Import the whole module
use std::println;

// Import one member
use std::io::stdout;

// Import multiple members
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};

// Import with alias
use deeply::nested::function as other_function;
```

Cool! Now we use the imported names, like...

```rust
println!(...);
stdout();
BufWriter::new(...);
other_function();
```



### Macros (Basic)

Sometimes you'll see what looks like function calls, but suffixed with an `!`. E.g. `println!()`

These aren't true function calls, rather, they are **macros** (or at least, one type of Rust macro... We won't go through the rest here.)

These are declarative function-like macros, which **cause code to be generated/substituted in at compile time** that is then built and run, possibly with passed in arguments. What this means is that it helps you remove a lot of boilerplate!



### Printing

Some examples adapted from [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print.html)

You can print to console (`stdout`) or error (`stderr`) with, respectively:

- `print!()`, `println!()`
- `eprint!()`, `eprintln!()`

The variants suffixed with `ln` appends a newline to the print.

```rust
println!("Rar");
```

Naturally, you can format the output as well (it's the reason why we're using macros!)

Here are some common uses, though it isn't [all of them](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html)!

```rust
println!("I say {}", "Rar");
println!("Stringify num: {}", 42);
println!("Stringify num, IN BINARY: {:b}", 2);  // Other formats work
println!("Stringify num, to some precision {:.5}", 0.1);  // 0.10000

println!("{0}{1}", "methyl", "Dragon");  // Positional arguments!
println!("Named {arg}", arg="arguments");

// Captured vars
let outside_var = "OUTSIDE";
println!("Print from {outside_var}!");  // "Print from OUTSIDE!"

// Padding
println!("{number:>width$}", number=1, width=6);  // "     1"
println!("{number:>width$}", number=1, width=6);  // "000001"

// Printing Tuples or Arrays (Use the debug format)
println!("{:?}", (1, 2, 3));
println!("{:#?}", (1, 2, 3));  // Pretty print

println!("{:?}", [[1; 5]; 5]);
println!("{:#?}", [[1; 5]; 5]);  // Pretty print
```



### Variables and Data Types

**Variables are like containers for data**

You declare them with the `let` keyword.

In Rust, variables are strongly typed. That is, every variable must be of some type. The cool thing, though, is for primitive types, Rust will **infer it for you** and automatically assign the type!

``` rust
let num = 10;                  // i32
let float = 10.0;              // f64
let string = "totally legal";  // &str
let bool = true;               // bool

// You can use _ as a separator!
let num = 11_22_33_44          // Becomes 11223344

// This throws error, since the default is i32 and it overflows
let num = 2147483647 + 1;
```

> **Note**: You can [use language keywords as identifiers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/compatibility/raw_identifiers.html). This is to allow using older libraries with newer versions of Rust.
>
> But... Please don't, it'll make your code uneccesarilly confusing.



#### **Data Types**

Here's a selection of some of the more commonly used **primitive types** you'll encounter.

| Description                 | Types                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Signed Integers             | `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize` (platform dependent) |
| Unsigned Integers           | `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize` (platform dependent) |
| Floating Point              | `f32`, `f64`                                                 |
| Characters (4-bytes)        | `char`                                                       |
| Boolean (`true` or `false`) | `bool`                                                       |

There is also another type, `()`, known as the **unit type**, which has a value of the **unit value**. This is what expressions implicitly return if they don't return any other value.



**Explicit Typing**

You can explicitly specify the type a variable should take! There's several ways to do this:

```rust
let float: f64 = 1.0;      // Regular
let num = 100i32;          // Suffix

let another_num = 100_i32  // With optional underscore separator

l(WIPet string: &str = "wow";  // Strings must be defined as reference
```

**Type Inference**

The Rust compiler is also smart enough to infer types from context!

```rust
// Source: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives.html
let mut inferred_type = 12;  // i64 inferred from context
inferred_type = 4294967296i64;
```

**Literals**

Adapted from [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html).

```rust
let hex = 0xff;         // 255
let octal = 0o377;      // 255
let bin = 0b1111_1111;  // 255
let byte = b'A';        // u8 only: 65 

let c = 'c';  // char is differentiated from string with single quote
let s = "s";  // Double quotes
```



#### **Mutable, Immutable**

**By default, Rust variable values are immutable**! You can't change them once you set them unless you explicitly declare them to be mutable.

```rust
let immutable_num = 10;
let mut mutable_num = 20;

// This throws error
immutable_num = 20;

// This doesn't
mutable_num = 10;
```

And for obvious reasons, the type of a variable, even if it is mutable, **cannot be changed**

```rust
// This throws error
mutable_num = true;
```



#### **Shadowing**

However, **BEWARE**, you may shadow variables!

```rust
let num = 10;
let num = 20;  // This works! You're defining a new variable in a new memory location, afterall
```

I really don't think you should be doing this though.



#### **Const**

So then, if variables are immutable by default, what the heck is the `const` keyword supposed to be?

Well, `const` and immutable variables are different!

- `const` declarations are compile-time constants that are immediately **inlined** (substituted) before parsing for compilation with their values without any name binding during runtime (think macro substitutions)
  - Good candidates for creating in the global scope
- Immutable variables are created and evaluated at runtime, so there is a name binding
  - You can't create them in the global scope with `let`!

For more in-depth info, see this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37881340), or the [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html).



### Variable Introspection

A selection of handy things you can do.

**Get Numeric Type Bounds**

The same applies to all the other numeric types, including unsigned, floats, and pointer-size (`size`).

```rust
i8::MAX;
i8::MIN;
```

**Get Type Names and Addresses**

> This is meant for diagnostic use only, you shouldn't be relying on this because sometimes it won't function as expected!

```rust
fn type_of<T>(_: &T) {
    println!("{}", std::any::type_name::<T>())
}

fn main() {
    // Get types
    type_of(&"wow");  // &str
    type_of(&42);     // i32
    type_of(&3.14);   // f64
    type_of(&true);   // bool
    
    // Get pointer addresses (yes, even literals have a location at runtime...)
    let n = 10;
    
    println!("{:p}", &"wow");
    println!("{:p}", &1);
    println!("{:p}", &n);
}
```

Nifty!



### Casting (`as`, `from`)

There's no implicit casting in Rust, only explicit casting. With...

**`as`** (Not recommended)

> Beware overflows with `as`! Shoving a larger data type into a smaller one will cause overflows, with [varying effects](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/types/cast.html).

```rust
let num = 65 as u8;   // 65
let c = num as char;  // 'A'
```

Note, you can't always do a cast.

```rust
// This fails because char casts only work with u8, and 65 is i32
let c = 65 as char;
```

**`from`** (Recommended)

`from` forbids overflows! It's safer that way!

```rust
let num = 65;
let c = char::from(num);
```



### Compound Data Types

#### **Tuples**

> Incidentally, the unit type `()` can be thought of as a tuple with no members!

Tuples allow you to group any number of values, and tuples:

- Can store elements **of differing types**
- Are **immutable**, you can't change its members, or its length

> **Modifying Tuple Values (You can't, but...)**
>
> Though you can't modify tuple values, tuples **can store mutable references** (that are themselves immutable, but have mutable values.)
>
> If you don't understand this yet it's fine, the knowledge you need to will probably be found later on when we talk about references and the borrow checker/memory management.

```rust
let inferred_tup = ("methylDragon", 1, 'a');           // With inferred type
let tup: (str, i32, char) = ("methylDragon", 1, 'a');  // With explicit type
```

You can then access their members by index, or by **destructuring**

```rust
tup.0  // "methylDragon"
tup.1  // 1
tup.2  // 'a'

// Destructure
let (x, y, z) = tup;
x  // "methylDragon"
y  // 1
z  // 'a'
```

You print tuples using the `{:?}` or `{:#?}` flags:

```rust
println!("{:?}", (1, 2, 3));   // (1, 2, 3)
println!("{:#?}", (1, 2, 3));  // Pretty version (Output has too many newlines to paste)
```



#### **Arrays**

Arrays are another way to have a collection of multiple elements, but:

- **Every element of the array must be of the same type**
- Arrays **always have a fixed length** (it's like C++ in that way.)
- The **elements themselves can be modified** as long as the array containing them is mutable

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];             // Inferred
let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];   // Explicit (with length!)

let c = [1; 5];                      // Pre-Initialized

// You can also nest arrays! (To practically infinite dimensionality)
let d: [[i32; 3]; 3] = [[1; 3]; 3];  // Create a 3x3 array, filled with 1s
```

You can access their members...

```rust
// By index
a[0];      // 1
b[0];      // [1, 1, 1];
d[0][0];   // 1

// By slice
// You're slicing the array reference, not the value
&a[0..3];  // [1, 2, 3]
```

And get their lengths

```rust
a.len();  // 5
```

You print arrays using the `{:?}` or `{:#?}` flags:

```rust
println!("{:?}", b);   // [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]
println!("{:#?}", b);  // Pretty version (Output has too many newlines to paste)
```



#### **Bonus: Vectors**

This is a bonus because it's not technically a primitive type, but it's so commonly used in the same sorts of contexts as arrays that it's much more useful to be here.

Vectors are contiguous arrays of **varying length**! So they have all the same limitations of an array, but **their length can change**.

You can use the `vec!` macro to initialize a vector instead of instantiating the actual `Vec` type manually. It's more convenient, and potentially faster.

```rust
// Most array syntax works, just prepend vec!
let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mut b: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mut c = vec![1; 5]

let mut d = vec![vec![1; 3]; 3];  // Nest them!
let mut e: Vec<Vec<i32>> = vec![vec![1; 3]; 3];  // Nest explicitly!

// We've seen these before...
b[2];                 // 3
&b[2..3];             // [3]
b.len();              // 5
println!("{:?}", b);  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Now let's modify our vectors!

```rust
a.push(6); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a.pop();   // Remove and return last element, if it exists: Gives us Some(6), a is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

println!("{}: {:?}", a.pop().unwrap(), a);  // "5: [1, 2, 3, 4]"
```

> We'll deal with `Some` later. But it basically just means it could potentially return nothing!

### Strings

Strings aren't exactly primitives either, but they're so commonly used, it's good to go through their basics.

> There are two types of strings in Rust: `String` and `&str`.
>
> - A `String` is stored as a vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`), but guaranteed to always be a valid UTF-8 sequence. `String` is heap allocated, growable and not null terminated.
> - `&str` is a slice (`&[u8]`) that always points to a valid UTF-8 sequence, and can be used to view into a `String`, just like `&[T]` is a view into `Vec<T>`.
>
> [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/str.html)

`String` is a vector of `u8`, `&str` is a view into that vector! Cool!

```rust
// Vector
let mut vec_str_implicit = "Rawr".to_string();          // Implicit
let mut vec_str: String = "Rawr".to_string();           // Explicit

println!("{}: {:?}", vec_str.pop().unwrap(), vec_str);  // "r: Raw"

// View
let view_str = "Rer";
```

For both kinds of strings, you can mess around with them! (Some of these ops don't require mutable):

```rust
view_str.chars().count();           // Get length of string: 4
let mut chars = view_str.chars();   // Get iterator to characters
let mut indiv_char = chars.next();  // Get next char in string (and iterate accordingly)

// Or collect it into a vector!
let chars_vec: Vec<char> = view_str.chars().collect();
println!("{:?}", chars_vec);        // ['R', 'e', 'r'] (Hilarious)
```



### Arithmetic and Math

#### **For Numerics**

**Basic Arithmetic**

```rust
+  // Add: 3 + 2 equals 5
-  // Subtract: 3 - 2 equals 1
*  // Multiply: 3 * 2 equals 6
/  // Divide: 3 / 2 equals 1.5
%  // Modulo: 3 % 2 equals 1 (Modulo returns the remainder!)

// These also work!
let mut n = 10;  // Mutable!!

n += 1;  // n = n + 1
n -= 1;  // n = n - 1
n *= 3;  // and so on...
n /= 3;
n %= 3;
```

> Notably, things like `n++` or `++n` do not work! They're deliberately left out to protect the programmer.

**Math Functions**

There's also a bunch of math functions too! Here are some relevant ones, see full listings in the respective primitive's docs (e.g. [f64](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html).)

```rust
// Abs only works on variables, it fails to convert silently on literals!
let mut neg_num = -4;

// Basics
neg_num.abs()        // abs(-4) = 4
2_i32.pow(8)         // 2 ^ 8
4_i32.powf(0.5)      // 4 ^ 0.5 = 2 (Square root!)

2_f64.sqrt()         // Square root
2_f64.cbrt()         // Cube root

4_f64.max(5_f64)     // 5
4_f64.min(5_f64)     // 4

4_f64.is_nan()       // Check if NaN
4_f64.is_infinite()  // Check if inf
4_f64.is_finite()    // Check if finite

// Rounding
1.23_f64.round()     // Round to closest int: 1_f64
4.56_f64.round()     // 5_f64
4.56_f64.floor()     // Round down: 4_f64
1.23_f64.ceil()      // Round up: 2_f64
1.23_f64.trunc()     // Return only integer part of number
1.23_f64.fract()     // Return only fractional part of number

// Exponentials
2_f64.exp()          // e ^ 2
4_f64.exp2()         // 2 ^ 4
2_f64.ln()           // ln(2)
2_f64.log10()        // log10(2)
2_f64.log2()         // log2(2)

// Trigo (functions are in radians!)
90_f64.to_radians()
3.14_f64.to_degrees()

90_f64.to_radians().sin()
90_f64.to_radians().cos()
90_f64.to_radians().tan()

90_f64.to_radians().asin()
90_f64.to_radians().acos()
90_f64.to_radians().atan()
90_f64.to_radians().atan2()
```



#### **Useful Numeric Properties**

These properties are part of the primitive type! Examples of some salient ones:

```rust
f64::DIGITS        // Approx significant figures
f64::EPSILON       // Smallest difference for type between 1.0 and next num
f64::NAN
f64::INFINITY
f64::NEG_INFINITY
```



#### **For Strings**

```rust
// Concatenation
// Requires String object at the start to concatenate (to_owned() converts the &str to String)
let mut a = "A".to_owned() + "B";  // "AB", of type: alloc::string::STring
a += "C";                          // Now we can do this

// Split by Whitespace
// ["Here", "be", "dragons"]
let mut ws_split = "Here be dragons".split_whitespace();  // This gives an iterator you can call `.next()` with
ws_split.collect();                                       // Or collect it into a vector...

// Arbitrary Split
// ["Here ", " dragons"]
let mut split = "Here be dragons".split("be");  // Same deal
split.collect();

// By newlines
"A\nB\nC".lines().collect();  // ["A", "B", "C"]
```



### Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `match`, `if let`)

#### **Operators**

**Comparison Operators**

```rust
== // equal to 
!= // NOT equal to
> // more than
< // less than
>= //  more than or equal to
<= // less than or equal to
```

**Logical Operators**

```rust
&& // AND
|| // OR
! // NOT
```

**Example Conditional**

>  Rust can handle parentheses around conditionals, but it'll throw warnings because it doesn't like it.

```rust
let dragon = "methyl";

if dragon == "methyl" {  // Automatically invokes dragon.eq("methyl")
    println!("You're looking at my reference!");  // Invokes this!
} else {
    println!("Oh no!");
}

// You can also chain them with else if
let n = 5;

if n < 5 {
	println!("a");
} else if n > 6 {
    println!("b");
} else {
    println!("c");  // Invokes this!
}
```



#### **`if` Expression**

You can also have conditional assignments!

```rust
let a = if x > 5 { 1 } else { 2 };  // If x > 5 { a = 1; } else { a = 2; }
```



#### **Match**

Adapted from: [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/match.html)

Pattern matching works too (like a `switch` statement in C!) The match **must be exhaustive**, otherwise Rust will not compile.

Matches are checked from top to bottom, and once a match is made, checking stops. It's as if you had a chain of `if` and `else ifs`.

**Basic Match**

```rust
let number = 13;

match number {
    // Match single value
    1 => println!("One!"),

    // Match several values
    2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 => println!("This is a prime"),  // <--- Only this gets triggered

    // Match inclusive range
    //   Notice: If the previous match gets picked up, we skip out!!
    //           This behavior might change, so beware
    13..=19 => println!("A teen"),

    // Handle the rest of cases, potentially passing that case in
    num => println!("Catch-all case: {}", num),
}

// If number was 13, it'd print "Catch-all case: 20" instead
```

**Match Guards**

Match guards are used to provide additional branches to a particular match, or to combine functionality with conditionals.

And this works with matched values too!

```rust
let pair = (2, -2);

// The conditions are guards!
match pair {
    (x, y) if x == y => println!("A: {x}, {y}"),
    (x, y) if x + y == 0 => println!("B: {x}, {y}"),
    (x, _) if x % 2 == 1 => println!("C: {x}"),
    _ => println!("Catch-all"),
}
```

**Binding Match**

[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html)

Matches can also destructure and deal with compound types! Here's some examples

```rust
match age {
    0             => println!("I haven't celebrated my first birthday yet"),
    n @ 1  ..= 12 => println!("I'm a child of age {:?}", n),
    n @ 13 ..= 19 => println!("I'm a teen of age {:?}", n),
    n             => println!("I'm an old person of age {:?}", n),
    }
}
```

**Enum Match**

[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html)

We'll talk about `Enum` later, but this is here for completeness

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

**Option<T> Match**

[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html)

Same thing with `Option`, we'll talk about it later.

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```

Binding works here too!

```rust
fn main() {
    match Some(42) {
        Some(n @ 42) => println!("The Answer: {}!", n),
        Some(n)      => println!("Not interesting... {}", n),  // Match any other number
        _            => (),                                    // Match anything else (`None` variant)
    }
}
```



#### **Bonus: `if let`**

[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/if_let.html)

This works for matching Enums or other types with matchable destructures. It's an alternative, cleaner way to do match cases.

```rust
// Adapted from: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/if_let.html
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
    Qux(u32)
}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Bar;
    let b = Foo::Baz;
    let c = Foo::Qux(100);
    
    if let Foo::Bar = a {
        println!("a is foobar");       // Triggers
    }
    
    if let Foo::Bar = b {
        println!("b is foobar");
    } else {
        println!("b is NOT foobar");   // Else block triggers
    }
    
    if let Foo::Qux(value) = c {
        println!("c is {}", value);    // Matches, passing in value
    }

    if let Foo::Qux(value @ 100) = c {
        println!("c is one hundred");  // Matches with binding
    }
}

```




```
                            .     .
                         .  |\-^-/|  .    
                        /| } O.=.O { |\
```
